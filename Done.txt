Add JavaScript code to read regex definitions from an array (inserted into the returned data server side for ace-builds-master/demo/autocompletion.html) and autocomplete with that data.
* ace-builds-master/gherkin-steps.js is read to find the step matches.
    It can be read from the current directory, src/main/resources, target/ or finally the resources


Add ability to save the current feature file.
*Ctrl+S
A request to save will send a PUT request to "http://localhost:8000/data/t.feature" containing the data to save.
The path "t.feature" is relative to the Java code current directory.



This URL parameter will set the filename to try to read and save when using the server: filename=t2.feature



Add ability to load a feature file from if there is a URL parameter like "http://localhost:8000/ace-builds-master/kitchen-sink.html?filename=foo/filename.feature".
The "foo/filename.feature" file is relative to the Java code current directory, not its resource directory.
